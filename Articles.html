<p >On September 23rd, Element, the world's first multi-chain aggregated NFT marketplace, announced a strategic partnership with Era7 to help sustain the "Era7 WCT": the first Web3 global light-competition event. According to the current plan, Era7 WCT will be held 6-8 seasons per year, with non-stop launch every two months, and the prize amount will be clearly arranged in the token launch plan and BUSD prize pool setting. The total prize pool is estimated to reach more than $5 million by 2023.

<p >Era7 is capturing the potential 1 billion TCG fans with a three-minute speedy game experience, rich card selection, diverse game strategies and high prize money. In traditional TCG games, players optimize their decks by purchasing card packs, and the circulation of cards is reflected in the fair recognized value and number of issues among players, while in Era7, players can also continuously optimize their decks by acquiring resources, while the value of each card can be fully reflected in the game's actual battle and marketplace, and the transactions among players become convenient and The value of each card is fully reflected in the game's actual battle and trade market, and the trade between players becomes convenient and safe.</p>
